# Concentration

This repository contains the python code related to the manuscript "Fast Diffusion leads to partial mass concentration in Keller-Segel type models" by J. A. Carrillo, M. G. Delgadino, R. L. Frank, and M. Lewin.

In the Results folder you can find the output of the scripts.


In even_lmb.py:

-) Option 1 finds the mass for just one specific value of alpha.

-) Option 2 calculates the mass of the solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation with parameter L=0 for different values of q. The output can be found in the folder mass within the Results.

-) Option 3 calculates the mass of the solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation for different values of L and q. It checks the monotonicity of the mass with respect to parameter L for a fixed value of q. The output can be found in the folder monotonicity within the Results.

The code explores the monotonicity for the dimensions d=4, 5, 6, 7, 8, lambda=6, 8, 10, q ranging in ( d/(d+lambda) , 1 ) and L ranging in ( 0.1 , 5 ).

The plots show the dependence of the mass with respect to the parameter L. We should note that the solutions can not be considered accurate for some choices of the parameters. 

The file derivative1.txt tracks the smallest decrease of the mass, when the error is below a tolerance threshold.
